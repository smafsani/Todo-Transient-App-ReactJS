# Todo-Transient-App-ReactJS
It is a Transient Todo App which is a simple task management application that allows users to create and manage a list of to-do items. However, unlike traditional todo apps, the transient version does not store the data permanently, meaning the list resets and starts anew every time the app is reloaded or the page is refreshed.
